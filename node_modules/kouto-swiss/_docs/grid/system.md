# grid system

**kouto swiss** comes with a semantic grid system, which can be fixed (by default), or fluid.

The grid system works in two steps : init the grid by calling the `gs()` function, then, into your selectors, define rows and columns with `row()`, `col()` and `offset()`.

The grid system of kouto swiss is inspired by those from [960.gs](http://960.gs) and [semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs).
